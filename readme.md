## Development

Apex mixer is written in Typescript & React. For styling, styled-components are used. Parcel is the bundler.

### Testing

`npm t` will do a single pass of Jest Tests

### Running

`npm start` will run a development server at `localhost:1234`

### Building

`npm run build` will produced a minified build at `dist/prod/`

### Publishing

`npm run publish` (**Not** `npm publish`) will produce a minified build in `/docs` where github pages serves it from. Typically this will only be done by a project maintainer so try to keep publishes out of pull requests.
